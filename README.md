ACCENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
The accent detection system for Nigerian indigenous languages (Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo) is a cutting-edge technological solution designed to precisely identify and classify accents, catering specifically to the diverse linguistic landscape of Nigeria. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, the system is built with TensorFlow, a powerful open-source library for machine learning and neural networks, which provides the flexibility and efficiency needed for such a complex task. Python, known for its simplicity and robust libraries, serves as the primary programming language, allowing seamless integration of various components and ensuring efficient processing of audio data. 
This accent detection system not only enhances linguistic research by providing valuable insights into the phonetic and phonological aspects of Nigerian languages but also has practical applications in language learning and voice recognition technologies.
